# CovidDataModeling
Machine learning project covering wide range of what I've learned during one of my univeristy courses. Main goal of this project was carrying out 
predictions (in both global and local cases) in order to establish if it is possible using delivered data.

I used dataset of nearly 200k observations for a global case and 1k records for local one (Spain). I conducted EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to get
to know data I had to deal with and pre-processed both sets in suitable way. After this part I used a lot of methods such as:

- linear regression
- multiple regression, 
- SVR 
- decision trees 
-random forest 

to make my predictions. 

All of my work and it's results are documented in OKowalik_COVID.ipynb file.
